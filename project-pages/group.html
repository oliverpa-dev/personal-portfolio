                            Welcome to the breakdown of my contributions to the group project called Noise Control.
                            Starting from 2023, a new law has been enacted which requires primary school students to
                            engage in at least 2 hours of physical education every week. Consequently, physical
                            education teachers will need to spend significantly more time in the gymnasium. However,
                            some of these teachers already face issues such as tinnitus, hearing loss, and other
                            problems associated with prolonged exposure to the gymnasium environment.</p>

                                        insights into the sound levels and stress during their classes?</span></li>

                                <li>Why: <span>To generate and develop new ideas.</span></li>
                                <li>How: <span>Initially, we began by distributing sticky notes to each person, allowing
                                        them to write down their individual ideas. Subsequently, we conducted a voting
                                        process to identify the most intriguing concepts. Once we had selected the
                                        noteworthy ideas, we proceeded to group similar ones together, consolidating
                                        them into clusters and ultimately condensing them into five distinct ideas.
                                        (Figure 1)</span></li>
                                <li>Results: <span>As part of the Noise Control group project, several measures are
                                        being implemented to address sound-related concerns in the gymnasium. These
                                        include the introduction of a light indicator system that uses red and green
                                        colors to signify potential sound hazards and a healthy sound environment,
                                        respectively. Additionally, a sound meter is being installed to consistently
                                        monitor and measure noise levels within the gym. Furthermore, smart wristbands
                                        will be provided to individuals, notifying them when they have been exposed to
                                        prolonged high sound levels and reminding them to take necessary breaks or use
                                        earplugs as a precautionary measure. These combined efforts aim to promote a
                                        safer and more comfortable environment for physical education teachers and
                                        students.

                                        sticky notes. Subsequently, we conducted a voting process to identify the most
                                        promising questions. Once the selection was made, we proceeded to group similar
                                        questions together and refined them to create one comprehensive question for
                                        each cluster. This process led us to formulate a main question and six
                                        sub-questions.</span></li>
                                <li>Results: <span>The research questions played a vital role in steering our research
                                        process, as they provided us with a roadmap for obtaining the necessary
                                        information to devise a successful solution. By deconstructing the main question
                                        into sub-questions, we were able to pinpoint potential areas of opportunity and
                                        explore the problem from various angles. This step was pivotal in establishing a
                                        strong foundation for the project and ensuring that we had a solid base to build
                                        upon.

                                <li>Research method: <span>Literature Study</span></li>
                                <li>Why: <span>: As the researcher, this approach grants me the opportunity to delve
                                        into the realm of existing knowledge, acquire contextual information, seek
                                        guidance, and uncover best practices within my field. Consequently, I can
                                        enhance my understanding and effectively apply valuable insights to the group's
                                        research.</span></li>
                                <li>How: <span>I began by exploring the question I was given and conducted thorough
                                        research on the internet to find relevant literature pertaining to that
                                        question. Although it proved challenging to locate the necessary information, I
                                        persevered and ultimately succeeded. Subsequently, I gathered and compiled the
                                        insights that I deemed valuable and intriguing within the context of the
                                        project.</span></li>
                                <li>Results: <span>
                                        In summary, various measures can be taken to improve acoustic conditions and
                                        reduce noise levels in classrooms. These include the use of acoustic ceiling
                                        tiles, carpets and rugs, acoustic panels, double glazing, sound-absorbing
                                        curtains, and sound-absorbing furniture. Acoustic ceiling tiles help absorb
                                        sound and minimize echo, while carpets and rugs contribute to sound absorption
                                        and noise reduction. Acoustic panels, when mounted on walls, effectively absorb
                                        sound and reduce noise levels. Double glazing helps to limit outside noise from
                                        entering the classroom. Sound-absorbing curtains and furniture with
                                        sound-absorbing properties also aid in reducing noise levels within the
                                        classroom environment. These solutions collectively aim to create a more
                                        conducive and quieter learning environment.

                                <li>Results: <span>The stakeholder interview revealed several significant points. The
                                        primary goal identified was the improvement of sports halls by requesting

                                        In summary, the app provides a free and subscription-free solution with features
                                        such as a sound meter capable of measuring up to 100 decibels. It offers
                                        indicators for maximum, minimum, and average decibel levels, along with
                                        color-coded indicators for distinguishing healthy and unhealthy sound levels.
                                        The app allows calibration of the microphone and includes a graph to visualize
                                        sound levels over time. Users can save a short report summarizing recorded sound
                                        levels. However, the app has limitations, including a hard-to-understand
                                        navigation user interface, lack of information about microphone calibration, and
                                        a maximum limit of 100 decibels. It may not provide the same accuracy as
                                        professional sound measurement tools and fails to explain the potential harm of
                                        certain sound levels to human health.

                                In conclusion, our brainstorming session yielded several potential solutions for improving sound levels and stress management in primary school physical education classes. The idea of an interconnected ecosystem centered around a smartwatch app emerged as an intriguing concept. Our research process, guided by well-defined research questions, allowed us to delve into the problem from various angles and identify areas of opportunity. We explored solutions such as acoustic treatments, individually controlled noise-reducing devices, and expert recommendations for sports halls. Evaluating existing sound meter apps revealed their strengths and limitations, highlighting the need for improved user interfaces, calibration guidance, and education on sound-related risks. By combining these insights, we can shape a comprehensive solution that addresses the challenges faced by physical education teachers and promotes a healthier learning environment. <a href="#"

When the decibel level reaches a threshold that could potentially impact hearing, the watch notifies the user through a gentle tap on the wrist. Apple suggests that the Apple Watch noise meter app generally aligns closely with proper noise meters during noise assessments. However, accuracy may be compromised when noise levels fluctuate significantly, causing the Apple Watch decibel readings to be less precise. Additionally, users can access more information about decibel levels by clicking on the info button, which redirects them to a separate page providing explanations on dB levels. <a href="#"

                                <p>As a collaborative team, we utilized the Useberry platform to integrate targeted questions and user flows specific to the sections we designed. This enabled us to gather valuable feedback on our design choices. I took the lead in conducting usability testing on the dosage timeline screen flow and also performed A/B testing on the latest iterations of the prototype that I developed. Initially, we faced some challenges during the test deployment, which prompted me to make necessary adjustments to the prototype overnight, ensuring a smooth and effective testing experience the following day. This iterative testing process allowed us to gather valuable insights and refine our design to enhance its usability and user satisfaction. <a href="#"

                                <p>After conducting a detailed analysis, I thoroughly examined the results, paying close attention to the click heat maps and user interactions with the prototype. This careful examination provided valuable insights into user behavior and engagement patterns. Furthermore, I compiled a comprehensive list summarizing the positive aspects and areas for improvement of the prototype. This evaluation process allowed me to assess the strengths and weaknesses of the design, enabling me to make informed decisions for future iterations and refinements aimed at enhancing the overall user experience. <a href="#"

                                Once the test was prepared and deemed ready, we expanded our participant pool to gather a larger volume of feedback, which could inform the development of a V2 version or guide our decision-making process. Following the test, we carefully analyzed the received feedback to extract valuable insights and actionable recommendations. The feedback revealed positive aspects of the prototype, such as its easy-to-read design and pleasing color scheme. Users appreciated the straightforward nature of the interface and found the inclusion of information about daily noise exposure to be valuable. The graph feature stood out as particularly useful, providing a clear understanding of the correlation between noise exposure and the time of day. Users also found it informative to see the decibel levels throughout the day and week, allowing them to identify potential areas of excessive noise exposure. However, there was initial confusion regarding the percentage values on the cards, which was resolved when users accessed the detailed graph. Some suggestions included adjusting the size of certain elements, such as the interface, to enhance the overall user experience. Overall, the feedback analysis highlighted the positive aspects of the prototype's design while also identifying areas for further clarification and optimization.
