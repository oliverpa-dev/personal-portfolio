                            Welcome to the breakdown of my contributions to the group project called Noise Control.
                            Starting from 2023, a new law has been enacted which requires primary school students to
                            engage in at least 2 hours of physical education every week. Consequently, physical
                            education teachers will need to spend significantly more time in the gymnasium. However,
                            some of these teachers already face issues such as tinnitus, hearing loss, and other
                            problems associated with prolonged exposure to the gymnasium environment.</p>

                                        insights into the sound levels and stress during their classes?</span></li>

                                <li>Why: <span>To generate and develop new ideas.</span></li>
                                <li>How: <span>Initially, we began by distributing sticky notes to each person, allowing
                                        them to write down their individual ideas. Subsequently, we conducted a voting
                                        process to identify the most intriguing concepts. Once we had selected the
                                        noteworthy ideas, we proceeded to group similar ones together, consolidating
                                        them into clusters and ultimately condensing them into five distinct ideas.
                                        (Figure 1)</span></li>
                                <li>Results: <span>As part of the Noise Control group project, several measures are
                                        being implemented to address sound-related concerns in the gymnasium. These
                                        include the introduction of a light indicator system that uses red and green
                                        colors to signify potential sound hazards and a healthy sound environment,
                                        respectively. Additionally, a sound meter is being installed to consistently
                                        monitor and measure noise levels within the gym. Furthermore, smart wristbands
                                        will be provided to individuals, notifying them when they have been exposed to
                                        prolonged high sound levels and reminding them to take necessary breaks or use
                                        earplugs as a precautionary measure. These combined efforts aim to promote a
                                        safer and more comfortable environment for physical education teachers and
                                        students.

                                <li>How: <span>Each team member contributed their ideas for questions on individual
                                        sticky notes. Subsequently, we conducted a voting process to identify the most
                                        promising questions. Once the selection was made, we proceeded to group similar
                                        questions together and refined them to create one comprehensive question for
                                        each cluster. This process led us to formulate a main question and six
                                        sub-questions.</span></li>
                                <li>Results: <span>The research questions played a vital role in steering our research
                                        process, as they provided us with a roadmap for obtaining the necessary
                                        information to devise a successful solution. By deconstructing the main question
                                        into sub-questions, we were able to pinpoint potential areas of opportunity and
                                        explore the problem from various angles. This step was pivotal in establishing a
                                        strong foundation for the project and ensuring that we had a solid base to build
                                        upon.

                                <li>Research method: <span>Literature Study</span></li>
                                <li>Why: <span>: As the researcher, this approach grants me the opportunity to delve
                                        into the realm of existing knowledge, acquire contextual information, seek
                                        guidance, and uncover best practices within my field. Consequently, I can
                                        enhance my understanding and effectively apply valuable insights to the group's
                                        research.</span></li>
                                <li>How: <span>I began by exploring the question I was given and conducted thorough
                                        research on the internet to find relevant literature pertaining to that
                                        question. Although it proved challenging to locate the necessary information, I
                                        persevered and ultimately succeeded. Subsequently, I gathered and compiled the
                                        insights that I deemed valuable and intriguing within the context of the
                                        project.</span></li>
                                <li>Results: <span>
                                        In summary, various measures can be taken to improve acoustic conditions and
                                        reduce noise levels in classrooms. These include the use of acoustic ceiling
                                        tiles, carpets and rugs, acoustic panels, double glazing, sound-absorbing
                                        curtains, and sound-absorbing furniture. Acoustic ceiling tiles help absorb
                                        sound and minimize echo, while carpets and rugs contribute to sound absorption
                                        and noise reduction. Acoustic panels, when mounted on walls, effectively absorb
                                        sound and reduce noise levels. Double glazing helps to limit outside noise from
                                        entering the classroom. Sound-absorbing curtains and furniture with
                                        sound-absorbing properties also aid in reducing noise levels within the
                                        classroom environment. These solutions collectively aim to create a more
                                        conducive and quieter learning environment.

                                        Wolf, and myself as a group.</span></li>
                                <li>Results: <span>The stakeholder interview revealed several significant points. The
                                        primary goal identified was the improvement of sports halls by requesting
                                        manufacturers to create holes in the walls, particularly in the main sound

                                        In summary, the app provides a free and subscription-free solution with features
                                        such as a sound meter capable of measuring up to 100 decibels. It offers
                                        indicators for maximum, minimum, and average decibel levels, along with
                                        color-coded indicators for distinguishing healthy and unhealthy sound levels.
                                        The app allows calibration of the microphone and includes a graph to visualize
                                        sound levels over time. Users can save a short report summarizing recorded sound
                                        levels. However, the app has limitations, including a hard-to-understand
                                        navigation user interface, lack of information about microphone calibration, and
                                        a maximum limit of 100 decibels. It may not provide the same accuracy as
                                        professional sound measurement tools and fails to explain the potential harm of
                                        certain sound levels to human health.

                                    is a summary of the session. The TQ4 building at Fontys faces multiple challenges
                                    that can be summarized in two problem statements. Firstly, the educational
                                    institution struggles with organizing study profiles due to the absence of clear
                                    definitions, schedules, indicators, difficulty in finding classes, issues with
                                    funding teachers, and booking rooms. These problems hinder efficient study
                                    organization and create confusion for students and staff.</p>
                                <p>Secondly, the lack of a designated social area in the facility leads to various
                                    issues such as inappropriate congregation of smokers, insufficient space for rest,
                                    and inadequate provisions for lunch breaks. This negatively impacts the comfort,
                                    health, and overall well-being of individuals in the facility. Additionally, the
                                    current system lacks adequate provisions for privacy, neurodiversity suitability,
                                    and an overall plan to address these issues, creating challenges for individuals
                                    with different needs and preferences. By addressing these problem statements, the
                                    educational institution can foster a more organized, inclusive, and supportive
                                    environment for all individuals.. <a href="#"

                                <p class="margin-bottom">In the context of human-centered design, the point of view for
                                    a student visiting the building 2-4 times a week involves two key needs: a clear
                                    definition of classes and activities in different areas and a sense of privacy,
                                    concentration, and an environment that fosters creativity. Insights from this
                                    perspective indicate that creating distinct zones within the building can address
                                    these needs effectively. By separating study areas from social or collaborative
                                    spaces, the building can provide a quieter atmosphere that promotes concentration
                                    and allows for focused work. This approach helps define specific activities,
                                    enabling students to easily identify suitable spaces for their needs while

                                    space. These ideas emphasize the importance of designing buildings that prioritize
                                    emotional well-being, social interaction, and sensory experiences to create
                                    empathetic and engaging environments. <a href="#"

                                <p>The video begins by showing the school's entrance filled with students. The camera
                                    then focuses on a new student who appears confused and frustrated. However, their
                                    attention is captured by an information board, prompting them to approach it. By
                                    utilizing the school's facial recognition system, the student's face is quickly
                                    scanned, and their profile opens up. In the following scene, the video presents the
                                    school's dynamic windows, where the main character witnesses the transformation of
                                    the weather from rainy to sunny. As the video progresses, the student follows
                                    vibrant and colorful pathways that guide them to the classrooms. Finally, the video
                                    demonstrates the functionality of the school's virtual boards. <a href="#"

                                    on the floor, ensuring she arrives at her group on time. The assistant then informs
                                    her that the meeting will begin in a few minutes and guides her along a blue path to
                                    the meeting room. Inside, the lights adjust according to her preferences, and the

                                <p>I participated in a two-week international project at TQ4 building, collaborating
                                    with students from different countries. Initially, communication difficulties and a
                                    struggle for leadership caused chaos and confusion. The main issue was the lack of a
                                    clear concept and plan, hindering progress. Establishing clear roles and
                                    responsibilities and creating a solid project plan based on a shared concept were
                                    crucial lessons learned. In future projects, I would address these challenges by
                                    agreeing upon team roles and developing a comprehensive project plan to guide our
                                    efforts and maintain a clear direction. <a href="#"
