                    <p>Welcome to our Design Challenge, where innovative thinking and practical problem-solving join
                        together to tackle a crucial societal issue. By adopting a human-centered perspective, we
                        aimed to develop revolutionary answers that have a beneficial influence on people and
                        communities. In order to fully comprehend consumer needs and goals, we collaborate across fields
                        and employ empathic design. We honed our ideas based on user feedback and ongoing learning using
                        effective techniques like brainstorming and prototyping. Together, let's question the status
                        quo, think creatively, and push the envelope of what is conceivable to build a future that is
                        both forward-looking and inclusive.</p>

                            to start with a small brainstorming session regarding the most confusing thing about the TQ4
                            building.
                        </p>

                            The main topic that everyone picked was navigation throughout the building. Furthermore, we
                            asked fellow students the same question and the result was the same, the navigation is the
                            main problem from their point of view.
                        </p>
                        <p>The next step was to create an empathy map in order to gain a deeper understanding of our
                            users.

                            Having finalised the empathy map it was time to create a persona of our target group which
                            is students.</p>

                                is playful, energetic, and engaging. Red-orange can also symbolize health and vitality.

                            <p>Gray is a mixture of black and white. It is timeless and versatile, making it a great
                                partner to a wide variety of colors. It is associated with cloudy days and, as a result,
                                is not the cheeriest color. Gray, however, is often used in interior design to create a
                                contemporary and sophisticated feel. <a href="#"

                            <p>During the development of the website, I was using vanilla JavaScript for the
                                functionality, HTML for the structure and CSS3 for adding styling properties into the
                                structure. Due to the lack of time, it wasn’t possible to make the entire website
                                responsive, so I did it only for the landing page. I used GitHub version control in
                                order to commit my code there in case anyone of my fellow students or lecturers would
                                like to check it out. The website is hosted as well. <a href="#"

                            <p>In summary, after conducting the test, the feedback I received was positive but there was
                                still room to improve, consequently, I had to make the following changes: adjusting the
                                direction of the arrow from right to down without the need for animation, resizing the
                                logo in the navbar to be larger than the navbar items, checking text size for
                                readability on different screen sizes, finding a solution to ensure the text on top of
                                the images in the tiles is still easily noticeable, considering hover effects such as
                                increasing gradient or image size, adding a button to scroll from the bottom to the top
                                of the page, ensuring images are included for projects to attract attention, and
                                emphasizing the importance of the image and title combination as the primary focus for
                                conveying information. For more details click read more. <a href="#"
