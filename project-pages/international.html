                    <p>Welcome to our Design Challenge, where innovative thinking and practical problem-solving join
                        together to tackle a crucial societal issue. By adopting a human-centered perspective, we
                        aimed to develop revolutionary answers that have a beneficial influence on people and
                        communities. In order to fully comprehend consumer needs and goals, we collaborate across fields
                        and employ empathic design. We honed our ideas based on user feedback and ongoing learning using
                        effective techniques like brainstorming and prototyping. Together, let's question the status
                        quo, think creatively, and push the envelope of what is conceivable to build a future that is
                        both forward-looking and inclusive.</p>
                        <p>My team was consisted of international students. They were from all of the parts of europe and from other continents as well. This multicultural composition offers a rich blend of perspectives, experiences, and expertise. Each team member brought their own cultural insights, language skills, and work approaches, contributing to a dynamic and inclusive work environment. This diversity fosters creativity, promotes global understanding, and allows for a wide range of ideas and solutions. The team's diverse backgrounds served a strong foundation for collaboration, learning, and mutual growth. </p>

                            to start with a small brainstorming session regarding the most confusing thing about the TQ4
                            building.
                        </p>
                        <p class="margin-bottom">
                            The main topic that everyone picked was navigation throughout the building. Furthermore, we
                            asked fellow students the same question and the result was the same, the navigation is the
                            main problem from their point of view.
                        </p>
                        <p>The next step was to create an empathy map in order to gain a deeper understanding of our
                            users.

                            Having finalised the empathy map it was time to create a persona of our target group which
                            is students. <a href="#"

                            <p class="margin-bottom">During the brainstorming session about problems at the TQ4 building belonging to Fontys, important ideas were generated, including the need for more specialists from different fields, improved navigation with clearer floor names and signage, a mobile app for locating classmates, a room booking system, a centralized information desk for finding teachers, addressing confusion through orientation sessions and detailed maps, providing clear definitions of different profiles, reducing noise with soundproofing measures, creating spaces for lunch and rest, and establishing a social area for interaction. These ideas can guide the further evaluation and planning to address the identified problems effectively.</p>

                            <p class="margin-bottom">The next step was to properly phrase a problem statement. This is a summary of the session. The TQ4 building at Fontys faces multiple challenges that can be summarized in two problem statements. Firstly, the educational institution struggles with organizing study profiles due to the absence of clear definitions, schedules, indicators, difficulty in finding classes, issues with funding teachers, and booking rooms. These problems hinder efficient study organization and create confusion for students and staff.</p>
                            <p>Secondly, the lack of a designated social area in the facility leads to various issues such as inappropriate congregation of smokers, insufficient space for rest, and inadequate provisions for lunch breaks. This negatively impacts the comfort, health, and overall well-being of individuals in the facility. Additionally, the current system lacks adequate provisions for privacy, neurodiversity suitability, and an overall plan to address these issues, creating challenges for individuals with different needs and preferences. By addressing these problem statements, the educational institution can foster a more organized, inclusive, and supportive environment for all individuals.. <a href="#"

                            <p class="margin-bottom">Having insights from the previous problem statement session, we decided to use POV method in order to phrase the final statement. This is a summary of the results</p>
                            <p class="margin-bottom">In the context of human-centered design, the point of view for a student visiting the building 2-4 times a week involves two key needs: a clear definition of classes and activities in different areas and a sense of privacy, concentration, and an environment that fosters creativity. Insights from this perspective indicate that creating distinct zones within the building can address these needs effectively. By separating study areas from social or collaborative spaces, the building can provide a quieter atmosphere that promotes concentration and allows for focused work. This approach helps define specific activities, enabling students to easily identify suitable spaces for their needs while encouraging a conducive environment for creativity.</p>
                            <p>Problem Statement: The student, who visits the building 2-4 times a week, lacks clear definitions of classes. The unwellcoming enviornment and structure of the building affect their work and  activities conducted, hindering their ability to navigate, learn and use the space effectively. <a href="#"

                            <p>During the brainstorming session, several innovative ideas were generated to address the problem. These ideas included implementing a personalized hologram greeter, utilizing augmented reality for wayfinding through QR codes and an app, using a color concept for room purposes, incorporating a playful guidance system, analyzing individual movement patterns and routines using AI, introducing color-changing chairs to indicate interaction or rest, treating the building as a living organism with digital signs and real-time maps, creating a real-time map for locating classmates and teachers, and incorporating voice-guided directions. These ideas aim to provide personalized, interactive, and engaging solutions to enhance the student experience within the building. <a href="#"

                                The brainstorming session revolved around exploring color patterns and their corresponding meanings, resulting in the identification of significant insights. Yellow represents fun, creativity, hope, happiness, and warmth; Orange signifies courage, creation energy, confidence, and optimism; Blue conveys trust, peace, calmness, wisdom, and the sensation of space while reducing appetite; Green symbolizes help, stability, self-reliance, and safety; and Pink is associated with calming, relaxation, and nurturing. These insights can be applied in various contexts, such as design and branding, to evoke specific emotions and create desired atmospheres. <a href="#"

                            <p>Following an expert interview with our mentor, the reiteration of ideas resulted in the following key points: an empathetic building aims to create empathy, understanding, and connection with users, considering their emotional and psychological needs; an emotional building focuses on evoking positive feelings and promoting well-being; shared areas encourage social interaction and community; smart lighting and acoustics enable programmable adjustments for optimal lighting conditions and improved sound quality; and sensory architecture recognizes the impact of sensory elements on individuals' well-being and experience within the space. These ideas emphasize the importance of designing buildings that prioritize emotional well-being, social interaction, and sensory experiences to create empathetic and engaging environments. <a href="#"

However, their attention is captured by an information board, prompting them to approach it. By utilizing the school's facial recognition system, the student's face is quickly scanned, and their profile opens up. In the following scene, the video presents the school's dynamic windows, where the main character witnesses the transformation of the weather from rainy to sunny. As the video progresses, the student follows vibrant and colorful pathways that guide them to the classrooms.

                                After we got to the building, some obstacles appeard and we had to adjust the script. In the first scenario, before the implementation of the personal AI assistant, student enters the building and encounters difficulties. She sees a blank whiteboard, struggles to find her class, and arrives late. Furthermore, when she finally reaches her meeting room, it is uncomfortably cold and disruptive noise from outside hampers her ability to focus.</p>
                            <p>In the second scenario, student enters the building and her face is scanned by an AI sensor. The personal AI assistant instructs her to follow a pink path that appears on the floor, ensuring she arrives at her group on time. The assistant then informs her that the meeting will begin in a few minutes and guides her along a blue path to the meeting room. Inside, the lights adjust according to her preferences, and the background music playlist aligns with her tastes, creating a personalized and comfortable environment. <a href="#"

                            <p>I participated in a two-week international project at TQ4 building, collaborating with students from different countries. Initially, communication difficulties and a struggle for leadership caused chaos and confusion. The main issue was the lack of a clear concept and plan, hindering progress.
