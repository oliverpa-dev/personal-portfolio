                    <p>Personal portfolio is the most common way of collecting and depicting skills and projects that you have worked on. It helps during the potential job interviews to explain all the relevant projects that you are proud of.</p>
                    <p>This portfolio is created with the purpose of showcasing work and skills in a clear and meaningful manner for teachers, fellow students, and potential employers.</p>
                    <p>It will contain various sections, including an "About me" section providing a brief background story, a resume, and a projects section, depicting the journey throughout the "Advanced Media" semester.</p>

                    <h2>Approach</h2>
                    <!-- <p>During this project, I will use Trello for dividing my weekly sprints into descriptive to-do tasks. The research part will be conducted with the use of the dot framework methodology in order to get insights and validate my answers. Wireframe and the prototype will be created in Figma and the final development of the product will be done with the use of CSS, JavaScript, and HTML.</p> -->
                    <div class="first-text_approach">
                        <p class="margin-bottom">Due to the short period that we have received for this individual project, I have decided to use two
                            different research approaches together; these are <strong>DOT Framework (Figure 2)</strong> and the <strong>Design thinking process (Figure 1)</strong>
                            Furthermore, I mixed them to get the best research results possible.
                        </p>
                        <p class="margin-bottom">In order to fit in those four weeks, I used those two approaches from above and created my own
                            process which consisted of three phases instead of five.
                        </p>
                        <p class="margin-bottom">The first stage is about the main research questions, their sub-questions, and methods that I have
                            used to execute with a short explanation of “why?”.
                        </p>
                        <p class="margin-bottom">The second stage explains the way of tackling the overall design of the portfolio, starting with the
                            brand identity. It consists of typography, color scheme, sketches, lo-fi, mid-fi, and high-fidelity
                            prototypes.
                        </p>
                        <p>The third stage and the last one showcases the testing that was done with students, the semester
                            coach, and the development of a real website.

                            <p>It was originally developed for use on signs, but in 2017, it was redrawn with a lighter weight to make it easier to read on the website, especially in long blocks of text, like the body text of a website.</p>

Eventually, the color was revolutionized and given a prominent standing in the world of fashion, quickly becoming a symbol of elegance and simplicity.</p>
                            <p class="margin-bottom">As its name suggests, red-orange is a cross between the two hues. More red than orange, it is bright and exciting and associated with physical energy. It is playful, energetic, and engaging. Red-orange can also symbolize health and vitality.</p>
                            <p>Gray is a mixture of black and white. It is timeless and versatile, making it a great partner to a wide variety of colors. It is associated with cloudy days and, as a result, is not the cheeriest color. Gray, however, is often used in interior design to create a contemporary and sophisticated feel.</p>
