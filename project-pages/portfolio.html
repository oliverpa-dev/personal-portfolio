                    <p>It will contain various sections, including an "About me" section providing a brief background story, a resume, and a projects section, depicting the journey throughout the "Advanced Media" semester.</p>

                    <!-- <p>During this project, I will use Trello for dividing my weekly sprints into descriptive to-do tasks. The research part will be conducted with the use of the dot framework methodology in order to get insights and validate my answers. Wireframe and the prototype will be created in Figma and the final development of the product will be done with the use of CSS, JavaScript, and HTML.</p> -->

                        <p class="margin-bottom">Due to the short period that we have received for this individual project, I have decided to use two
                            different research approaches together; these are <strong>DOT Framework (Figure 2)</strong> and the <strong>Design thinking process (Figure 1)</strong>
                            Furthermore, I mixed them to get the best research results possible.
                        </p>
                        <p class="margin-bottom">In order to fit in those four weeks, I used those two approaches from above and created my own
                            process which consisted of three phases instead of five.
                        </p>
                        <p class="margin-bottom">The first stage is about the main research questions, their sub-questions, and methods that I have
                            used to execute with a short explanation of “why?”.
                        </p>
                        <p class="margin-bottom">The second stage explains the way of tackling the overall design of the portfolio, starting with the
                            brand identity. It consists of typography, color scheme, sketches, lo-fi, mid-fi, and high-fidelity
                            prototypes.
                        </p>

                            coach, and the development of a real website.

By keeping the wireframes low-fidelity, I could focus on the overall structure and layout. This facilitates faster exploration of different design options and helps in refining the user experience. It helps in visualizing and communicating the basic structure and functionality of a design concept. The wireframe provides a clear representation of the content hierarchy, navigation elements, and overall layout, enabling effective communication with stakeholders, clients, and development teams.
